# Superstore Sales Dashboard – Excel Project
## Problem Statement 
The Superstore had a large dataset of sales, transactions, and customer details spread across regions, categories, and years. Raw data was unorganized, making it difficult to track performance, identify growth areas, or make data-driven decisions.
## Objective 
The goal was to clean and structure the dataset using Power Query, generate pivot reports for better analysis, and design an interactive dashboard that provides clear visibility into sales, transactions, customer segments, and trends.
## Tools Used  
- **Excel** (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboarding)  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Power Query  
- **Visualization** – Excel Dashboard
## Process  
1. Imported raw sales dataset into Excel.  
2. Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query** (removed duplicates, handled nulls, standardized formats).  
3. Built **Pivot Tables** to summarize key metrics (sales, transactions, quantity).  
4. Designed an **interactive dashboard** with filters (Region, Year).  
5. Interpreted insights and provided recommendations.
