# Superstore Sales Dashboard – Excel Project
## Problem Statement 
The Superstore had a large dataset of sales, transactions, and customer details spread across regions, categories, and years. Raw data was unorganized, making it difficult to track performance, identify growth areas, or make data-driven decisions.
## Objective 
The goal was to clean and structure the dataset using Power Query, generate pivot reports for better analysis, and design an interactive dashboard that provides clear visibility into sales, transactions, customer segments, and trends.
## Tools Used  
- **Excel** (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboarding)  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Power Query  
- **Visualization** – Excel Dashboard
## Process  
1. Imported raw sales dataset into Excel.  
2. Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query** (removed duplicates, handled nulls, standardized formats).  
3. Built **Pivot Tables** to summarize key metrics (sales, transactions, quantity).  
4. Designed an **interactive dashboard** with filters (Region, Year).  
5. Interpreted insights and provided recommendations.
## Key Insights 
- **Total Sales**:Reached ₹58,20,182 across 9,994 transactions with an average sale of ₹582.
- **Shipping Mode**:Standard Class contributed the majority of sales (58%), Second Class contributes 20%, First Class 16%, while Same Day orders were least used (6%).
- **City Wise**:New York leads with ₹6,54,439 in sales, followed by Los Angeles (₹4,20,553) and Philadelphia (₹3,09,973).
- **Category-wise**:Office Supplies led with 6,026 transactions, followed by Furniture (2,121 transactions) and Technology (1,847 transactions).
- **Customer Segments**:Consumer segment leads with 13,030 units, followed by Corporate (7,598) and Home Office (4,495).
- **Monthly Trends**:Sales peak in October (3,039) - November (2,858), lowest in February (1,351).
## Key Takeaways

- Customers prefer **cost-effective shipping** over premium options.  
- Seasonal spikes in Q4 highlight festive/holiday demand.  
- Technology and Furniture categories need more focus to balance sales.
## Recommendations
1. Launch **festive season promotions** (Oct–Nov) to maximize revenue.
2. Expand focus on **Corporate & Home Office clients** with bulk order discounts.  
3. Improve **Same Day shipping services** to attract premium buyers.  
4. Invest in **category diversification** by boosting Technology & Furniture sales.  
5. Strengthen presence in **underperforming regions** to reduce reliance on metros.
## Impact
